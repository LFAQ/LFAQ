Here,We provide three kinds of test datasets for LFAQ:
  
* The MaxQuant dataset is the results of yeast sample (DDA) mentioned in our manuscript.  
* The mzQuantML dataset (yeast proteins with UPS1 standards 
* spiked in) is downloaded from <a href= "https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQuantML/blob/master/examples/version1.0/label-free/maxquant-label-free.mzq">https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQuantML/blob/master/examples/version1.0/label-free/maxquant-label-free.mzq</a> . It contains 12 samples, so the computation  will take about several minutes.
* The SWATH dataset is the results of yeast sample (DIA) mentioned in our manuscript.
